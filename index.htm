							 Throughout the world, there are many unexplored places that hold mysteries and dangers. One such place, would be the Sentinel Island. The Sentinelese people are a kind of people that prefer to live autonomously. Typically, they stay within the forest and remain close-knit with one another. However, local fisherman in the area reported witnessing strange activity on the island. They claim to have witnessed half of the Sentinelese community fleeing the forest. Recently, I decided to make the trip and investigate this matter myself. The reports appear to be honest...As I have witnessed this unusual activity from the Sentinelese. To my knowledge, it appears that they may be avoiding something within the forest.<br><br>
							Additionally, I have noticed them patrolling the area and watching the forests for any dangers. They appear to be unusually quiet with a strong lack of aggression. As they flee to the beaches, I have noticed that our estimations of their numbers appears to be inaccurate...Or these numbers have significantly dropped.<br><br>
							I have decided to continue my investigation and complete a further report.

						  Today, I had noticed a strange occurrence on the island. While on my search I witnessed a Sentinelese woman running from the forest. She was covered in blood and appeared to have bitemarks on her forearm. It looked as if the wound was recent and she ran to the shore for help. Upon meeting her people, they immediately executed her. Following this, the Sentinelese people burnt her remains.<br><br>
						  This was incredibly unusual as they do not enact any atrocities against one another.<br><br>
						  Later in the day, I saw the brushes moving with my binoculars. I could not tell what it was but it appeared to be human...Mostly. Whatever human that was, it had strange spores and fungi imbedded into it's skull. Before I could make sense of what it was the creature returned to the forest. I suspect whatever this creature is has something to do with the strange behavior of the Sentinelese.<br><br>

						  Norvell didn't give me much fuckin' time to prepare for this shit. He said get in and get out. Those damned fucks were constantly patrolling the island. It was nearly fuckin' impossible. Thought I was gonna be shot on sight... Not to mention those freaks are known to be aggressive. But it didn't matter... 'Cuz if I didnt hurry my ass up Norvell was gonna turn me into Sunday bacon.<br><br>
						  Well... It turns out the rumors were fuckin' right. We lost Johnny on this fuckin' trip. When we went in there the forest was silent...Until it wasn't. We heard rumblin' or somethin'. It was like my grandma when she was coughin' down her meds every mornin'. Sounded sick. Almost like it was dyin'. Thought we heard voices in the forest...We ended up tryina check it out. Moved toward the voices. Assumed it was just those people talkin' their speech.<br><br>
						  What we saw was certainly not human. Looked like a meth addict covered in snakeskin and raw meat. The stench was indescribable. I felt like I had walked straight into Satan's grasp...Like the scent of billions a' dead folk entered my nostrils.<br><br>
						  The guy...or whatever... we saw didn't seem to notice us... We were able to nab it, but then the damn thing had the strength of a god-damned bear. It was impossible to hold it down. The thing trashed around for a while. Got it's claws deep into Johnny. Poor fucker started screamin' at the top of his lungs...Johnny ended up running into a damn tree, bleedin' everywhere. Behind him we saw another one a' those monsters... It came out..Face covered in some weird mushrooms or somethin'. Damn fucker started some sorta matin' call. That's when the rest of 'em came. Those things grouped around Johnny like my kids at a Thanksgivin' dinner.<br><br>
						  Before we knew it they were pullin' him into the forest. All we heard were his screams.<br><br>
						  Fear overcame us...we finally nabbed that fucker. Maybe it was adrenaline or somethin'. Pulled him to the boat and got the fuck outta there.<br><br>
						  Tied it down. Whatever it is.<br><br>
						  Now it's Norvell's.</p>

							Good evening fancy computer,<br><br>
							I hope this personal letter by yours truly meets you well...<br><br>
							Recently, I’ve hired a runt to explore some little island called North Sentinel. I told him specifically to hurry and if he didn’t... he’d be going on a permanent vacation all expenses paid. <br><br>
							He even did the honors of giving me a gift of some absolutely disgusting live sculpture. Maybe it’s European? Amish?<br><br>
							...Regardless I didn’t even want the ugly thing...until I was informed only the richest of the rich know about it. So then I had a genius idea!Why not bring it to my gala and show it off in front of the other rich assholes and the women who cleary aren’t their wives.<br><br>
							My sister will not be attending because she’s “enjoying the family yacht too much.” (What a spoiled brat! I don’t see why we’re even related sometimes.)<br><br>
							Nonetheless I'll be displaying the art piece at my gala in a five million dollar cage. My maids and butlers have been informing me that the sculpture’s been “growling” and “making weird sounds.” Now they're nagging about how something “bad is going to happen." I told them to get back to work on preparing my gala or they’ll be forced to clean all nine of my beach houses...with no pay!<br><br>
							Anyways computer...I’ll see you again after my gala.<br><br>
							Yours truly,<br><br>
							Jay Norvell<br><br>
